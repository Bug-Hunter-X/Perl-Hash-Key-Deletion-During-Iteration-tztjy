This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl when deleting keys from a hash while iterating over it using a foreach loop.  The code in `bug.pl` shows the problematic approach, while `bugSolution.pl` presents solutions to avoid this issue.  Deleting keys during iteration can cause unpredictable behavior, as the loop's internal index might become invalid.  The solutions provided offer safer ways to manage key deletions in such scenarios.
